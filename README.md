# Typescript & Express with MSAL Authentication

I put this project up based on the sample Microsoft App Registration Node project, but using Typescript as opposed to keeping in JS files.

In addition I've moved the source files, Views, and used more partials to make it more modular and structured.

If you find this helpful let me know.
